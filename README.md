# STM32-Based High-Gain Quadratic DC–DC Boost Converter

This project presents the design and implementation of a high-gain quadratic DC–DC boost converter, based on a topology published in an IEEE paper.  
The converter is controlled using an STM32 microcontroller, and PWM signals are configured via STM32CubeMX.

The converter was analyzed theoretically in MATLAB/Simulink and tested experimentally on a physical prototype.

The study includes:
- Voltage gain behavior under different duty cycles
- Output voltage stability and regulation
- Efficiency calculations

Results show that the system performs in accordance with theoretical predictions, and STM32-based digital control is successfully achieved.
